* conflict with toggle-input-method
In the mini search buffer ~C-;~  is binding to `embark-act`. It's conflict with [[~/.doom.d/modules/neo-emacs/rime/config.el][toggle-input-method]].
- There have two solution:
  - Disable short cut ~C-;~ ,we need chage file here in [[~/.emacs.d/modules/completion/vertico/config.el][vertico/config.el]].
  - The short cut ~C-SPC~ seems more popular for `toogle-input-method`, cause windows have a default setting for ~C-SPC~.So a better way is binding ~C-SPC~ to `toogle-input-method`

** code advice
Automatically to evil normal mode when `J` `K` be clicked.
It's actually a advice regard to `+workspace/switch-right` and `+workspace/switch-right`.
#+begin_src lisp
(map! :n "K"                  '+workspace/switch-right               )
(map! :n "J"                  '+workspace/switch-left                )
#+end_src
